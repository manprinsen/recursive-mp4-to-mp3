>  The following script will recursively iterate over files in a given directory. It will convert mp4/m4a files to mp3 files and after it's done it will clean up the mp4/m4a files.
> 
> Let's get started

pip install moviepy

Download the `mp4-to-mp3.py` file

Edit the `mp4-to-mp3.py` file and adjust the following variables to match your needs: 

 - `START_DIRECTORY` => in what folder do you want to convert mp4/m4a files to mp3?
 - `CONCURRENT_JOBS` => how many conversions of mp4/m4a to mp3 shall run at the same time?

Then run  `python mp4-to-mp3.py`

Happy hacking
